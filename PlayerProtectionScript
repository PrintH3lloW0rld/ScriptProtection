    Guardian: User-End Script Protection
    Prevents Scripts from Stealing In-Game Items
    Ex: PS99 Mail, Bank, Pet Stealer
    Ex: RCE Vulnerability in Script
    Ex: Logs Username to Discord (via Webhook)
    Use this Script to be Protected againsts malicious scripts
    Works with Raw Github, Pastebin and more.

    Note:
    If you have full trust in the script,
    you may pay no attention to it and remove it.
    Otherwise, it's best to to keep it in for additional protection
